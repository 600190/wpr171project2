                <p> 
                    History of the Internet: The internets foundations were laid in the 1960's with the creation of ARPA. This
                    initial network allowed research universities to share data and other resources across different devices within that network
                    This modal however was limited as these small networks could not share data to other small networks. This was solved by the
                    developer of TCP/IP which enabled these small, sepearated network to communicate with another and ultimatly create a global
                    network we now know as the internet.

                <h1>Evolution of the Internet</h1>
                <p>
                    The Dot-Com  Boom was a period in the late 1990's, where internet-based buisenesses experienced a big growth. Companies like
                    Amazon,eBay, and Google emerged, forever changing how we shop, search for information, and stay up to date with current and new information.
                    Broadband and Mobile Revolution: The 2000's brought widespread adoption of broadbrand internet, enabling faster access to content.
                    With the evolution of smartphones and the intorduction of 4G, accessing the internet became even easier and lead to the era
                    of mobile internet. People were virtually always connected to the internet through their smartphones or other mobile devices.
                    In recent years, the internet has extended beyond computers and phones. Everyday objects, from smart thermostats to wearable
                    devices, are able to connect to the internet, creating a network of interconnected devices. This is referred to as Internet of Things.
                    Like the internet, the web also evolved and went through phases and different eras as technology advanced. The evolution of
                    the internet also played a vital role in the changes of the web.

                <p>
                    Internet Protocols are essential for communication betweem devices. Protocols refer to established rules dictating the
                    arrangement of message strucures and procedural steps. These rules facilitates the exchange of information between devices
                    application programs. It is important for all communication devices to observe and adhere to these rules, to ensure that
                    the receiving host can accuratly interpret the transmitted message.
